FARM2CUSTOMER-Connecting Farmers and Customers
Our project addresses the challenges faced by small-scale farmers, such as a lack of direct market access and fair pricing, by creating a digital marketplace to connect them directly with customers.
The primary purpose is to build a secure, user-friendly platform that empowers farmers to sell their products, ensuring they receive a fair price while minimizing post-harvest losses.
We developed a full-stack web application using a Flask backend and a responsive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For a proof of concept, we used Excel files for data persistence, but the system is designed to be scalable for a full database integration.
The result is a platform with dedicated dashboards for both farmers and customers, featuring product management, a shopping cart and a secure payment process, which creates a transparent and efficient supply chain.
In conclusion, the FARM2CUSTOMER platform demonstrates the potential for technology to bridge the rural-urban divide, promote economic equity for farmers, and provide customers with access to fresh, high-quality produce.
